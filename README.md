# HooMessage (A Social Media App)

For this project, I chose to create a social media app that mirrors Twitter. This project is still in development, but feel free to play around. The NewsAPI that's integrated into my app will update you with current news. You can click on the links to take you to their respective pages.

To run the NewsAPI: Open the terminal cd into the server directory and run `node server.js`
To run the project directory: Open the terminal make sure you're in the project's root directory and type `npm start`
